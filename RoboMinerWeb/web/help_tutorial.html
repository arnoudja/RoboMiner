            <h1>Tutorial</h1>
            <p class="helptext">
                RoboMiner is an on-line programming game.
                The goal of the game is to improve a mining robot to mine as efficient as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                There are several options to improve the mining efficiency of the robot:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upgrade the robot equipment.</li>
                <li>Improve the robot program.</li>
                <li>Mine in better mining area's.</li>
                <li>Avoid a robot being idle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="helptext">
                This tutorial will explain the first steps in improving your robot.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 1: Keep your robot busy</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                An idle robot isn't very useful.
                When you've logged in, you end up on the 'Mining queue' page.
                Click on the 'add' button.
                The status will change to 'Mining' and a count-down timer will start.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                When the count-down timer reaches zero, click on the 'add' button again.
                The mining process will continue when you switch to another page, log out of RoboMiner and even when you turn off your computer.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                By mining you generate ore, which will be useful later.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2: Claiming achievements</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                Now click on the 'Achievements' item in the top menu bar.
                When you've finished some mining sessions in step 1, the first achievement will be claimable.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Click the 'claim' button.
                In this case, a mining queue slot is one of the rewards.
                Return to the 'Mining queue' page and click the 'add' button.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                As you can see it is possible to have two mining sessions in the queue, which makes it much easier to keep your robot busy.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Check your achievements regularly to check for claimable achievements.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3: Check the mining results</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                Now open the 'Mining results' page.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Here you can see the results of your last mining sessions.
                Click on the 'View' link to start an animation of the mining session.
                Or click on the '+' button to see more details.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                You can use this information to decide how to improve your robot next.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 4: Upgrade your robot</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                When you've got at least 10 Cerbonium ore, go to the 'Shop' page.
                An 'Enhanced Ore Container' is a good first upgrade.
                Switch the 'Category' selection if you prefer something else.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Click the 'Buy' button to buy the item.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Now open the 'Robot' page.
                Switch the selection of the type of item you've bought to the newly bought item and click 'Apply'.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Repeat this process for other upgrades, but don't forget to check your mining results to find the weakest spots of your robot.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 5: Improve your robot program</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                This is the most challenging step of improving your robot.
                Open the 'Edit code' page.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                You'll see the program currently active for your robot.
                When the program ends, it will restart until either the battery is depleted or the mining session is over.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                A first good change is the mine() statement.
                In most cases, the robot won't be able to mine all the ore on the current location in one mining step.
                So by executing mine() only one time, a lot of ore is skipped.
                To see this for yourself, view some mining animations in the 'Mining results' page.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Replace the line 'mine();' with 'while (mine());'. Now click on the Save button.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                If your robot is idle, the program is applied immediately. If not, you'll get a warning.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                To apply the robot code when the robot is busy, go to the Robot page and press the Apply button.
                The program will be used by your robot after the current mining session.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Wait for at least one mining session to finish and view the animation on the 'Mining results' page.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Click on the Help button on the Edit code page for more information about improving your code.
