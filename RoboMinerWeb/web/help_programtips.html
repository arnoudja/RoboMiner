            <h1>Programming tips</h1>
            <p class="helptext">
                This section contains some tips and tricks for programming your robot.
            </p>
            <h2>Repeated mining</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                The default program includes the mine(); action.
                However, most of the time your robot won't be able to gather all ore from the mining spot with only one mining action.
                Since the mine() action returns the amount mined, you can use a while loop to continue mining until there is no ore left:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
while (mine() > 0)
{
}
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                When the while loop is started, the while-expression is evaluated.
                When the expression evaluates to 'true', the code-block is executed and the process is repeated.
                When the expression evaluates to 'false', the code-block is skipped and the program continues after the while loop.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Since the actual action, the mining, is already done in the expression, the code-block can be empty.
                To make the code more simple, we can skip the body altogether by adding a semicolon after the expression:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
while (mine() > 0);
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                There's another trick to make the code more efficient.
                A numeric value of 0 will be evaluated as 'false', all other numeric values will be evaluated to 'true'.
                The mine() action itself will return 0 when nothing is mined, which will be evaluated as 'false'.
                It will return a value larger then zero when something is mined, which will be evaluated as 'true'.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                So by replacing 'mine() > 0' by 'mine()', we get exactly the same result:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
while (mine());
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                This will efficiently mine all ore from the current robot position.
            </p>
            <h2>One-time actions</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                When the robot reaches the end of its program, the program is restarted.
                This is fine with the initial code, but sooner or later you'll want to add some code that's only executed once.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                To achieve this, you can use a while-loop.
                A while loop contains a block of code that is repeatedly executed until the expression evaluates to 'false'.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The expression can be some calculation or comparison, but it can also be a constant value.
                When you use the constant value 'true', the block is executed repeatedly until the mining session ends or the robot's battery is depleted.
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
&lsaquo;Insert the one-time code here&gt;

while (true)
{
    &lsaquo;Insert the repeated code here&gt;
}
            </p>
            <h2>Detecting a collision</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                You can move your robot forward by using the 'move(..)' command.
                Sooner or later, however, your robot will collide with a wall or another robot.
                Ignoring this collision and continuing to move forward will repeat the collision over and over again,
                assuming the robot you're colliding with doesn't solve this problem for you.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                To continue looking for ore to mine after a collision, there are two steps needed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect the collision.</li>
                <li>Take action to avoid repeating the same collision over and over again.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="helptext">
                The move(..) command returns the actual distance traveled.
                This can be used to detect the collision.
                For instance, replace the default 'move(1);' with the following:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
if (move(1) &lt; 0.9)
{
    &lsaquo;Insert some smooth collision-avoiding moves here&gt;
}
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Now why is the move result compared with 0.9 and not with 1?
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The mine() command always returns a round number, the amount of ore mined.
                This can be 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. but never 0.5 or 1.3.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The move(..) command, however, returns a 'floating point' value.
                And the actual distance traveled can be 1.00000001 or 0.9999999.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                When we compare to 1 and the actual distance traveled turns out to be 0.9999999,
                we would assume we've collided with something while we didn't.
                So by comparing to 0.9 we can avoid this mistake.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                For the same reason, comparing to 0 would be unsafe while 0.1 would be a good value.
            </p>
            <h2>Avoiding repeated collisions</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                When we've detected a collision, we need to do something to avoid repeating that collision on the next move.
                There are a lot of ways to do this, so don't be afraid to try something completely different from this example.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The first action we could do is moving backwards a bit.
                Moving backwards is done with the 'move(..)' command too, but with a negative distance instead of a positive.
                'move(-1);' for example would do the trick.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                As a next step we could do a rotation.
                'rotate(135);' will rotate the robot clockwise.
                If you prefer to rotate counter-clockwise you can use a negative number.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                As a final step we can move forward again.
                Since the robot is moving in another direction now, chances are we won't collide anymore.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The final code, including the collision detection, will look something like this:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
if (move(1) &lt; 0.9)
{
    move(-1);
    rotate(135);
    move(1);
}
            </p>
            <h2>Selective mining</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                Most ore fields contain more then one type of ore.
                However, you're most probably only interested in one type.
                Since your ore container has a limited size and the mining session has a limited amount of cycles,
                you'll prefer your robot to pick the right type of ore instead of mining everything it can find.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The easiest way would be to tell your robot to mine only the best type of ore.
                However, since the robots mining unit can't tell the difference between the types of ore, the solution needs to be more complicated.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The mining unit can't tell the difference between two types of ore, but the ore container can.
                The 'ore(..)' command will tell you how much ore there is in the container:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>'ore(0)' will tell the total amount of ore in the container.</li>
                <li>'ore(1)' will tell the amount of the highest quality ore in the container.</li>
                <li>'ore(2)' will tell the amount of the medium quality ore in the container.</li>
                <li>'ore(3)' will tell the amount of the lowest quality ore in the container.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="helptext">
                We can use the 'ore(1)' value to keep track of the amount of high quality ore.
                By comparing the result of 'ore(1)' before the 'mine()' action with the 'ore(1)' value after the 'mine()' action,
                we can tell whether we've mined the ore we want or not.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Since the 'ore(1)' value will only tell us the current amount of high quality ore in the container and not the previous amount,
                we'll need to store the 'ore(1)' value before we start mining.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                For this, we can use a variable:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
int amountBeforeMining;

do {
    amountBeforeMining = ore(1);
    mine();
} while (ore(1) > amountBeforeMining);
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                This will repeat the mining process until there is no more high quality ore to mine at the current robot location.
            </p>
            <h2>Ore heaps</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                Ore is concentrated in heaps.
                In the first mining areas, just searching for ore and picking it up will work fine.
                As the mining areas get more difficult, however, the number of times your robot runs into an ore heap of the right type will decrease.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                When your robot does run into the right type of ore, you want it to pick up as much of its ore as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                This can be achieved with three steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect when the robot enters an ore heap.</li>
                <li>Detect when the robot leaves an ore heap.</li>
                <li>Move back into the ore heap.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="helptext">
                For the first step, we'll use a variable which we will set to true when we've mined something.
                For example:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
bool inOreHeap = false;
&lsaquo;other initialisation code&gt;

while (true)
{
    // Check whether ore is found.
    if (mine())
    {
        // Ore found, so we are in an ore heap.
        inOreHeap = true;

        // Mine the rest of the ore at the current location.
        while (mine());
    }

    &lsaquo;Movement, collision detection etc.&gt;
}
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                This way, when the robot mines something, it will remember it did so.
                For this example, the robot accepts any type of ore.
                But of course you can change the code in such a way that the inOreHeap variable is only set to true when the right type of ore is found.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                As a second step, we want to detect when the robot leaves an ore heap.
                Ore heaps are round, so when the robot mines in a straight line we know the robot leaves the heap when:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The robot detected an ore heap.</li>
                <li>The robot didn't find ore in the new location.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="helptext">
                The tricky part here is the 'new location'.
                When the robot mines all the ore in one location and then makes a move of 0.5, for example, changes are the robot is still in the same location.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                To avoid this, make sure your move is about 1.42.
                The squares are one by one, so the distance between two opposite corners is just under 1.42.
                By moving at least 1.42, we can make sure the robot is in a new location after the move.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Again, we'll use a variable to store the information.
                After adding this, it will look something like this:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
bool inOeHeap = false;
bool leftOreHeap = false;
&lsaquo;other initialisation code&gt;

while (true)
{
    // Check whether ore is found.
    if (mine())
    {
        // Ore found, so we are in an ore heap.
        inOreHeap = true;

        // Mine the rest of the ore at the current location.
        while (mine());
    }
    else if (inOreHeap)
    {
        // No ore found, but we're in an ore heap, so we just left it.
        leftOreHeap = true;
    }

    &lsaquo;Movement, collision detection etc.&gt;
}
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Now the robot knows when it detected an ore heap and it knows when it left it.
                The next step is to take action when the robot leaves the ore heap.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Depending on the 'leftOreHeap' variable, the robot can move normally or try to head back into the ore heap.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                There are a lot of ways to try to get back into the ore heap.
                We don't know whether the robot entered it through the middle, right part or left part.
                For this example we pick an easy way: The robot makes a large turn and we hope it enters the heap again.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Making a complete 180 degree turn won't be a good idea.
                The robot will end up exactly on the path it just mined clear.
                So we'll make a 160 degree turn.
                Feel free to try other values between 90 and 180.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The code now looks something like this:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
bool inOreHeap = false;
bool leftOreHeap = false;
&lsaquo;other initialisation code&gt;

while (true)
{
    // Check whether ore is found.
    if (mine())
    {
        // Ore found, so we are in an ore heap.
        inOreHeap = true;

        // Mine the rest of the ore at the current location.
        while (mine());
    }
    else if (inOreHeap)
    {
        // No ore found, but we're in an ore heap, so we just left it.
        leftOreHeap = true;
    }

    if (leftOreHeap)
    {
        // Try to head back into the ore heap.
        rotate(160);
    }

    &lsaquo;Movement, collision detection etc.&gt;
}
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Now there is one more change to make.
                The code will work fine when the robot is lucky enough to re-enter the ore heap right after the turn.
                But when it doesn't, it will keep moving in a circle!
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                After the robot has done the 160 degree turn, we want the variables to be reset to their original values.
                When the robot does run back into the heap, it will detect it in the same way again.
                When it doesn't, the original search for ore will continue.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The final code will look something like this:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
bool inOreHeap = false;
bool leftOreHeap = false;
&lsaquo;other initialisation code&gt;
