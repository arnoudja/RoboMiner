            <h1>Programming tips</h1>
            <p class="helptext">
                This section contains some tips and tricks for programming your robot.
            </p>
            <h2>Repeated mining</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                The default program includes the mine(); action.
                However, most of the time your robot won't be able to gather all ore from the mining spot with only one mining action.
                Since the mine() action returns the amount mined, you can use a while loop to continue mining until there is no ore left:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
while (mine() > 0)
{
}
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                When the while loop is started, the while-expression is evaluated.
                When the expression evaluates to 'true', the code-block is executed and the process is repeated.
                When the expression evaluates to 'false', the code-block is skipped and the program continues after the while loop.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Since the actual action, the mining, is already done in the expression, the code-block can be empty.
                To make the code more simple, we can skip the body altogether by adding a semicolon after the expression:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
while (mine() > 0);
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                There's another trick to make the code more efficient.
                A numeric value of 0 will be evaluated as 'false', all other numeric values will be evaluated to 'true'.
                The mine() action itself will return 0 when nothing is mined, which will be evaluated as 'false'.
                It will return a value larger then zero when something is mined, which will be evaluated as 'true'.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                So by replacing 'mine() > 0' by 'mine()', we get exactly the same result:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
while (mine());
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                This will efficiently mine all ore from the current robot position.
            </p>
            <h2>One-time actions</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                When the robot reaches the end of its program, the program is restarted.
                This is fine with the initial code, but sooner or later you'll want to add some code that's only executed once.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                To achieve this, you can use a while-loop.
                A while loop contains a block of code that is repeatedly executed until the expression evaluates to 'false'.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The expression can be some calculation or comparison, but it can also be a constant value.
                When you use the constant value 'true', the block is executed repeatedly until the mining session ends or the robot's battery is depleted.
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
[Insert the one-time code here]

while (true)
{
    [Insert the repeated code here]
}
            </p>
            <h2>Detecting a collision</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                You can move your robot forward by using the 'move(..)' command.
                Sooner or later, however, your robot will collide with a wall or another robot.
                Ignoring this collision and continuing to move forward will repeat the collision over and over again,
                assuming the robot you're colliding with doesn't solve this problem for you.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                To continue looking for ore to mine after a collision, there are two steps needed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect the collision.</li>
                <li>Take action to avoid repeating the same collision over and over again.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="helptext">
                The move(..) command returns the actual distance traveled.
                This can be used to detect the collision.
                For instance, replace the default 'move(1);' with the following:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
if (move(1) &lt; 0.9)
{
    [Insert some smooth collision-avoiding moves here]
}
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Now why is the move result compared with 0.9 and not with 1?
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The mine() command always returns a round number, the amount of ore mined.
                This can be 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. but never 0.5 or 1.3.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The move(..) command, however, returns a 'floating point' value.
                And the actual distance traveled can be 1.00000001 or 0.9999999.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                When we compare to 1 and the actual distance traveled turns out to be 0.9999999,
                we would assume we've collided with something while we didn't.
                So by comparing to 0.9 we can avoid this mistake.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                For the same reason, comparing to 0 would be unsafe while 0.1 would be a good value.
            </p>
            <h2>Avoiding repeated collisions</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                When we've detected a collision, we need to do something to avoid repeating that collision on the next move.
                There are a lot of ways to do this, so don't be afraid to try something completely different from this example.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The first action we could do is moving backwards a bit.
                Moving backwards is done with the 'move(..)' command too, but with a negative distance instead of a positive.
                'move(-1);' for example would do the trick.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                As a next step we could do a rotation.
                'rotate(90);' will rotate the robot one quarter of a round clockwise.
                If you prefer to rotate counter-clockwise you can use a negative number.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                As a final step we can move forward again.
                Since the robot is moving in another direction now, chances are we won't collide anymore.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The final code, including the collision detection, will look something like this:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
if (move(1) &lt; 0.9)
{
    move(-1);
    rotate(90);
    move(1);
}
            </p>
            <h2>Selective mining</h2>
            <p class="helptext">
                Most ore fields contain more then one type of ore.
                However, you're most probably only interested in one type.
                Since your ore container has a limited size and the mining session has a limited amount of cycles,
                you'll prefer your robot to pick the right type of ore instead of mining everything it can find.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The easiest way would be to tell your robot to mine only the best type of ore.
                However, since the robots mining unit can't tell the difference between the types of ore, the solution needs to be more complicated.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                The mining unit can't tell the difference between two types of ore, but the ore container can.
                The 'ore(..)' command will tell you how much ore there is in the container:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>'ore(0)' will tell the total amount of ore in the container.</li>
                <li>'ore(1)' will tell the amount of the highest quality ore in the container.</li>
                <li>'ore(2)' will tell the amount of the medium quality ore in the container.</li>
                <li>'ore(3)' will tell the amount of the lowest quality ore in the container.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="helptext">
                We can use the 'ore(1)' value to keep track of the amount of high quality ore.
                By comparing the result of 'ore(1)' before the 'mine()' action with the 'ore(1)' value after the 'mine()' action,
                we can tell whether we've mined the ore we want or not.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                Since the 'ore(1)' value will only tell us the current amount of high quality ore in the container and not the previous amount,
                we'll need to store the 'ore(1)' value before we start mining.
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                For this, we can use a variable:
            </p>
            <p class="codeexample">
int amountBeforeMining;

do {
    amountBeforeMining = ore(1);
    mine();
} while (ore(1) > amountBeforeMining);
            </p>
            <p class="helptext">
                This will repeat the mining process until there is no more high quality ore to mine at the current robot location.
            </p>
